# WHU_STM32
This project requires `STM32CubeIDE` and `VSCode`, you may want to edit the `compilerPath` om `c_cpp_properties.json`.

Implemented a simple device that triggers an alarm when the temperature is not within a certain range.

Several safety measures are used in the code. You can simply find them.

> The cpp header file maybe bugged, but I don't want to spend any time on fixing them.
